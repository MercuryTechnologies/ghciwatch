# This workflow runs when PRs labeled `major`, `minor`, or `patch` are closed
# and increments version numbers. Then, it opens a PR labeled `release` for the
# changes. When that PR is merged, a release is created (see `release.yaml`).
#
# Are you here because I left Mercury and now my personal access token is
# invalid for workflows, breaking CI? You'll want to go to
#     https://github.com/MercuryTechnologies/ghcid-ng/settings/secrets/actions
